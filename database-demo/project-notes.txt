1 - Without using row mapper

public List<Person> findAll() {

        return jdbcTemplate.query("select * from person",
                new BeanPropertyRowMapper(Person.class));
    }

reason for using row mapper is to match the name both bean and database

2- for entity in JPA , if the name of java and sql attribute are matched , no need for @Column

3- for JPA we do not need to create table command , JPA does that for us. so remove the "create table " command from data.sql
